# practical-data-types-definitions
JS definitions and identifier logic for Practical Data Types Project

Definitions are designed to be binary and granular; fuzziness
should be achieved by the blend of identified definitions
rather than by a percentage likelihood of any one definition being true.

That's the design anyway... we'll see if it holds true ;)

## Usage

import { identifier, definitions } from practical-data-types;
